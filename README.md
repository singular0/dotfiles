# singular0 dotfiles

My dotfiles for Arch Linux and Mac OS X.

## Installation

First install [Homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) (you will also need Ruby for that):

```
gem install homesick
```

Then download dotfiles:

```
homesick clone singular0/dotfiles
```

And finally symlink them to your home dir:

```
homesick symlink dotfiles
```
